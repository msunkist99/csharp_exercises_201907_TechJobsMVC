    // TODO #3 - DONE - Use the same list display from Views/Search/Index.cshtml
    // TODO BONUS - COMPLETE - Using the same loop in two different places -- as we did in Views/Search/Index.cshtml and Views/List/Jobs.cshtml-- isn't very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). To fix this would require partial views. Read up on partial views and use them to eliminate this repeated code.
